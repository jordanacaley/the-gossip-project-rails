# The Gossip Project with Rails

This project uses Ruby on Rails to build a relational database. Users in different cities can create and comment on gossips. They can also like gossips and comments. They can also send and receive private messages with other users. I still need to figure out how users can comment on comments (polymorphism)!

1. Download the code
2. Run ```bundle install``` in your terminal
3. Run ```rails db:seed``` in your terminal
4. Run ```rails console``` to explore the different relationships
5. Run ```tp NameOfModel.all``` within the console to visualize the data in neat tables
